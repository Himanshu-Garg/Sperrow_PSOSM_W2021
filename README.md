## Overview

* To curb the spread of fake news, we wanted to give the user a passive nudge. 
* This nudge would be in the form of summaries of news articles corresponding to the event the user is posting about crawled from the web. 
* This is displayed just beneath the actual tweet the user is about to post. 
* Thatâ€™s it, the extension does not instruct neither recommends the user certain changes, but rather just passively lays out useful facts in an easy to read and comprehensible way. 
* This way, we encourage self aware fact checking, and since real time automated fact checking is a difficult task, the proposed solution encourages user participation in tackling an otherwise hard problem
